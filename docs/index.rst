Ford cars come with powerful in-car navigation systems that help drivers find their way properly, whether they are driving through city traffic or going on a cross-country road trip. But as time goes on, the maps on your Ford GPS system may get out of date, which can make the directions wrong or leave out points of interest. To avoid this, you need to update your Ford GPS maps often.

This article goes through all the steps needed to update a Ford GPS map, from getting ready to putting it in.

Why it's important to update your Ford GPS maps
The infrastructure of the roads is always evolving. New highways open, road names change, construction zones pop up, and businesses move. Using old map data can cause:

Taking the wrong turn and going the wrong way

Missed places and new addresses

Roads that are closed or slow traffic

More gasoline used and time squandered

Regular updates maintain your Ford's navigation system accurate, reliable, and in sync with changes in the real world.

How to Use Ford Navigation Systems
The SYNC infotainment system is widespread in Ford cars. Models with SYNC 3 or SYNC 4 have built-in GPS. Trusted partners like HERE or TomTom give these systems map data that they can use.

It's a good idea to check your vehicle's SYNC version before updating. You can do this from the screen that shows information:

To learn more about SYNC, go to Settings > General > About.

Make a note of the version of the software and the build of the system.

This will tell you what tools and methods you need to utilize to upgrade.

Things You Need and Tools for the Update
To upgrade your Ford GPS map system, you need to get the following:

A machine running Windows or Mac

A USB flash drive with at least 32GB of space (for SYNC 3)

Connection to the internet at high speed

Access to Ford's official portal for map updates

Car with the ignition on or in auxiliary mode

Some later Ford cars can also get updates over the air using Wi-Fi, however most map updates still have to be done by hand.

How to Update Your Ford GPS Map in Steps
Step 1: Get the USB ready in your car
Start your Ford's engine or go into accessory mode.

Put a USB drive into the USB port in the car.

The system will gather information about the car and the route, which is needed to download the right update files.

Wait until the machine is done writing the data before taking out the USB drive.

Step 2: Go to the Update Portal
Visit the Ford map update page on your PC.

Choose your area and type in your Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).

Get the right update tool (like Ford Navigation Installer) and install it.

Put your USB into the computer. The program will read your system data and show you any updates that are available.

Step 3: Get the Maps
The software will ask you to start downloading if there is an update for the map.

Pick the destination (USB drive) and wait for the process to finish. It could take up to two hours.

Once the download is done, safely remove the USB.

Step 4: Put the Update in Your Ford
Go back to your car and put in the new USB.

The SYNC screen will see the update and ask you to confirm it.

To start the installation, follow the instructions.

The USB should stay plugged in and the car should stay powered on during the whole operation.

It could take up to an hour to install. When you're done, a notice will show up on the screen saying that everything went well.

How to Update Your Ford GPS Without Problems
Get a good USB drive. Don't use USBs that are outdated or broken.

Don't shut off the car. This could stop the update and lead to mistakes.

Be patient. It may take some time to update, but it makes sure that everything works as well as possible.

Put a label on your USB. This will help if you ever need to check the update or reinstall it.

How often should you change your maps?
Ford says you should update the maps on your GPS once a year. Depending on your car and subscription plan, updates may be free for a while after you buy them, but then you may have to pay for them.

You can use your VIN to see if there are any map updates available on Ford's update site or in your Ford Owner account.

Fixing Problems with Updates
Problem: The vehicle doesn't see the USB
To fix this, format the USB to exFAT or FAT32 and then do the data collecting process again.

Problem: The software doesn't see the USB
Solution: Put the USB back in the car and make sure the system info was collected successfully.

Problem: The update got stuck or didn't work
Solution: Start over and leave the car on for the whole installation.

Ford's customer care or dealership support can help with particular troubleshooting or manual updates if problems keep happening.

Benefits of New Ford Navigation: It gives you accurate directions based on new road information.

Faster travel times thanks to better route planning

Alerts for speed restrictions and road hazards make driving safer.

Better searches for fuel, food, and services at POIs

Your Ford car is a better travel companion with a new GPS system, whether you're driving through cities or out in the country.

Last Thoughts
It's not hard to learn how to update a Ford GPS map, but it does take a few steps and some time. If you take the effort to keep your maps up to date, you'll have a smoother, safer, and more efficient driving experience.

Updating your navigation system on a regular basis will make sure that your Ford keeps giving you clever, accurate, and reliable route planning, so you can be sure you're going the right way.
